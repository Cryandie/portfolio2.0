        Seedbytes-School is a web application designed to simplify the
        organization of an institution such as a school or school or gym. The
        objective is to facilitate communication between the different agents
        and to provide them with tools that simplify their daily tasks while
        facilitating the flow of information. My role was to create everything
        that is related to the teacher by offering him an ergonomic dashboard
        that assists him in his daily tasks. If you want to access you need to
        select -Enseignant- then enter test@test.com in the username and
        password fields.
